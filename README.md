# RPG-Godot-Game
This is a game I made in under a week using Godot for a game jam on itch.io. It's a story about someone who is alone for Valentine's Day, but their friends help 
them realize that they DO have people around them who love them!

For obvious reasons, this isn't ALL of the code for the game. Just the more complicated pieces of code. If you want to play the actual game, you can find it here:

Thank you :)
